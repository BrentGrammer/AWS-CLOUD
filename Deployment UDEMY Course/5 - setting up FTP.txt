FTP - 


*** Useful to quickly move files to the server

Can be used as an alternative to get files to your server if you don't use git.

***IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THIS WITH GIT - IT WILL MESS YOUR REPOSITORY UP.

IF YOU KNOW GIT, THEN JUST USE GIT OVER THIS.


Using FTP allows you to move files to your server without having to use the terminal and through a GUI.


1) Install FileZilla FTP client (for your OS).

2) Open FileZilla and click on Open Site Manager in the top left or from the dropdown.

3) Click NEW SITE and type a name to label it (i.e. Brents AWS Server, etc.)

4) Copy your IP Address for your EC2 Instance and paste it into the HOST field on the right panel (under the general tab)

5) Change the Protocol from FTP to SFTP for using the SSH port (22).  FTP is not secure and the port for it is not enabled on the firewall.

6) Change logon type to be key file - this is the pem key file (even on windows).  Click browse to find your .pem file on your computer and select to use it.

7) Set the user to be ubuntu (unless you created a different user to use here).

8) Click CONNECT and Ok if you get a SSH warning (the first time only - if this pops up again, you should be concerned).

-You can now navigate through the server in the GUI on the right side under `Remote Site: ` 

You can drag project files over to var/www/html folder - You need to have permissions as the right user:

CHANGING OWNERSHIP OF HTML TO USE FTP:

2) $ sudo chown -R ubuntu html/

// this sets a ubuntu owner for the html folder
// type $ ls -l to check new ownership
