SSH into your server - use putty on windows


If you don;t have git installed on EC2 server use command:

$ sudo apt install git

1) get the clone link for your project on git.

2) delete the html directory from var/www/html:

$ sudo rm -r html/ 

// do this command from the var/www folder

3) $ sudo git clone <project link> html

// this puts your project files into the html folder where apache serves assets from to requests coming in on port 80

NOTE: you may need to use the https link and not the ssh one for it to work.
