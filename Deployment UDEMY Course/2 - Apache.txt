*APACHE is a piece of web server software that does nothing but handle HTTP Traffic.

-Apache listens for any incoming HTTP requests on the server machine and handles them appropriately.

glossary:

PORTS: Linux handles certain traffic a certain way depending on the port the request comes in on.  Port 80 is specifically for HTTP traffic, port 443 is for https, port 22 is SSH port.  


-----------------------


APACHE COMMANDS AND SETUP:

Install:

$ sudo apt install apache2

// install an apache server - respond Y to install the extra dependencies.
Check apache install with $ sudo service apache2 status (press CTRL-C to exit the status view)

Note: to list files in a dir use:

$ ls -l

$ sudo service apache2 status 

// shows if apache is running

----

$ cd /etc/apache2/

// navigates to the apache directory where apache is installed.
-The master main config file for apache is the apache2.conf
(can open with $ vi apache2.conf -- exit with $ :q!)

--

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

-set in /etc/apache2/envvars

$ vi envvars 
// opens the file defining env variables

-------------

FILES TO CONFIGURE HANDLING HTTP OR HTTPS:

-These config files are located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/

000-default.conf ===> this configures handling regular http traffic
default-ssl.conf ===> This configs https traffic

-To inspect the files use:

$ vi <filename>

$ :q! exits the editor.

--- File conents:

<VirtualHost *:80>


// this means that the apache server can host multiple servers as a virtual host and *:80 means to listen for anything from any domain that comes in on port 80 and run when that occurrs.

DocumentRoot /var/www/html 

// This means that any requests coming in on port 80 will be served whatever is specified here.  There will probably be an index.html file in the html folder.

======================

ALLOWING PORT 80 ON FIREWALL:

-You need to initially allow traffic on port 80 in your firewall rules.

Linux has a built in firewall it uses with apache that initially blocks traffic on port 80.

Allow Traffic through firewall:

1) Go to AWS Console to your EC2 instance page and scroll to the right and open the launch-wizard in the last column.

2) Click on the Inbound Tab, then EDIT.

3) Select HTTP from the Type dropdown menu which will fill out the port for you.
(The 0.0.0.0/:0 means that any ip address can access port 80.)

-Can add optional note at the end

4) Click Save.

-You can now go to view the default Ubuntu page if you copy the public IP address for your EC2 instance into the browser URL bar.
