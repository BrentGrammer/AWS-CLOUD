DOMAIN SETUP WITH AWS:

-Google and GoDaddy are the most popular.

Typical cost is $12/year

-Any domain site is fine to use to buy a domain.

-Note: You can add any subdomain to your domain purchased.
i.e. blog.mainsite.com
     store.mainsite.com
     www.site.com


Setting up a domain with Google:

1) go to their site at https://domains.google/#/

2) Click manage my domains.

3) Click to search for a domain or transfer one.

4) Enter a domain name in the search bar (might have to change settings to show available domains only first).

-Add to cart and checkout to buy it.

5) After purchasing, Go to My domains ---> set the Use the Google Domains name servers option.

6) If you want to set up GSuite for gmail (i.e. your email@yourDomain.com) then you can set up Synthetic records.  

7) Set up CUSTOM RESOURCE RECORD: Allows you to do whatever you want with your domain.  You can add a subdomain here if you want or just put in @ symbol (this will make this custom record handle any requests to any subdomain on your domain.)

8) select the record:

A record option: points the domain at an IP address
CNAME record option: points domain at another domain
MX Records: used for email servers

A record is selected by default (you can leave it unless otherwise desired).
Note: TTL is time to live - how long it takes before the domain is propogated and accessible on the internet.  
This typically takes around 15 seconds.  You can leave the default setting on TTL.

9) Copy your IPv4 IP address from the EC2 console on AWS dashboard and paste it into the IP address field.

10) Click Add on the right and you are done.
  You may need to wait some time before the domain progogates on the internet.

SETTING UP A DOMAIN WITH GODADDY:

1) Sign in to GoDaddy and under the domains section click on the DNS button to list a display of records for the domain.

2) Click the pencil to edit the A record (first in the list) and put in your IP address for your EC2 instance.
This will point the domain to your EC2 server on AWS.

*You can create an A record by clicking ADD at the bottom.

HOST - this is what goes before the domain name (you can put @ or www etc.)

POINTS TO - this is where you put your IP address.
