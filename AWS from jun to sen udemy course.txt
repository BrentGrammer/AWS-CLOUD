The most common AWS services:

S3

--------------

EC2 Service:

-This is the basic general purpose bare metal server on AWS where you can run your backend or server (instead of Digital Ocean or Heroku for example)

S3 Service:

-An Object Storage Service.  Each piece of data (i.e. a file, etc.) is considered an object and is associated with an id key.  You can store images, files.  You could save profile pics for users, etc.
*Limit is 5 GB of storage.

Lambda Service:

-Back end functions can be stored and run as needed.  They can also scale automatically as needed.  (i.e. an insert image photo when a user uploads a pic for example).

------------------

Cloudfront Service:

-Like a CDN - a worldwide network of data centeres where your files can be served from and speeds up distribution of your data over the wire.  HTML/CSS, JS and Image files can be put on cloudfront for faster delivery through a worldwide network of data centers.  Provides automatic https.  

DynamoDB Service:

-A key/value storage database.  Reliable and performant - used across many different types of platforms and apps.

ADVANTAGE OF MICROSERVICES:

-Each part of the application can be updated and maintained individually by teams and is modularized instead of being coupled in a monoloithic setup.  


-Service Level Agreement (SLA) - 
A standard for a response sent between two parts or services of the application that ensures that no matter what updates are done to either, each will expect a certain a response in a certain way.
